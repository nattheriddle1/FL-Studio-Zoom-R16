The [Zoom R16](https://zoomcorp.com/en/us/digital-mixer-multi-track-recorders/multi-track-recorders/r16/) can be used as an audio interface and MIDI controller with a DAW, and even though Zoom hardly ever mentions it, [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio/) is compatible!

However, the FL Studio generic controller maps the MIDI signals from the R16 to very non-intuitive controls, even leaving some unmapped. This FL Studio MIDI script written in Python fixes this, mapping the keys and faders on the R16 to intuitive controls.
